# The React 2023 Getting-Started Tutorial for tac-tac-toe in TypeScript, with Tests

- The 2023 Tutorial : https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe
- The Testing Library for React : https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/
- Typescript https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html

### Testing React and the DOM

Whilst the React getting started tutorial is great, you have to look elsewhere to get started with react and unit testing. As ever, “elsewhere” is confused by legacy documentation. I feel like:
- https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react#dom-testing
- https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/

are as good as I've found in 2023 for “get started with unit testing in react”

To use Testing Library, you will want to spend half an hour learning [ARIA basics](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/), including how an <em>accessible name</em> is computed, and following some of the links from there, e.g. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles.

## From the “Getting Started with Create React App” README
